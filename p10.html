        Description
      </h1>

      <p>
       The first place that I went for a sightseeing in New York is the Central Park. As an animal lover, I started to observe what are the differences between Chinese parks and New York ones. Bothe of them have plenty of trees, grasses, some tiny hills and some lakes - perfect settings for wild lives living on the land, near the lake, in the woods and in the waters. There are multiple types of birds living in different habitats. There are arthropods living there too. But one thing that I found out, is that the numbers of squirrels are extremely large . There are also no wild cats nor wild dogs. I never seen so many squirrels like that in Chinese parks before, and I started to think that maybe the non-existence of small polyphagues animals such as cats and dogs  provide more foods for the squirrels, or the squirrels are stronger than cats and dogs and win the competition of foods. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to see what squirrels did for fighting against cats and dogs and show their lives in the same time,  I made this script that recorded 809 observations of the squirrels. 
      </p>

        The above images are the processes of my design. The page of the sketch is inspired by the google web page since I found the google searchingg engling is really useful. I add 3 buttons, the button on the left tat leads the previous pages, the center button that can incert page numbers, and the button on the right that eards to the next page. 
        In order to do that, I used the mouse pressed function to create the button that shows the data that appeared on the screen. 
      </p>
   
        Besides the buttons, I also wrote some user instructions which tells people how to oppurate the sketch. This helps people to understand how the sketch works in a short amount of time. 
       <p>
        
      </p>
        Also, for further decorations and pointing out the main theme of the sketch, I selected a patterned wall paper of squirels as a back ground and a rotating actor on the first page. In order to make the back ground less messy and ake the words clearer, I added some squares, colored in gery or irange, behind the layer of data and instructions.  
       <p>
          By sepurating the pieces of words in different catalogues and pages, the users can understand what they are doing,
         what will happen next, and they have the chance of regret their decision(go to the previous page).
