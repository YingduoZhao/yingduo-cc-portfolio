        "I lost a phone two years ago that was not storing my information on
        iCloud. I lost all my photos from fun nights, the music library I was
        building for several years, the passwords in my notes app, and nostalgic
        text messages from people I no longer talk to. I cherish memories from
        my teenage years, which is why losing that phone was so painful.
        Obviously we can all still remember specific time events in our minds,
        but seeing a live picture or a video still is different. Everyone has
        iphones nowadays, but mine was an iphone X with a red phone case with
        star stuck on the right side, and a picture of my boyfriend and my best
        friend inside the case. There was a background photo of a cityscape I
        found in Pinterest, and the lock-page time would always be set up as a
        24-hour clock(military time)”                      ——Aisha

        While reading her words, the first thing that come up from my mind is a
        red phone case and a phone which lies between the cracks of memories. It
        might lie in ashes in a forgotten corner, or might be thrown in to
        underground pipes and then abandoned into the sea following city wasts.
        However, it's still living in Ashia's brain and it never fades away, and
        that's why I decide to make a picture of a phone that have bright and
        beautiful color. I want to make the viewers think that this phone is not
        lost, but still "living" vividly inside Ashia's mind. I drew a still-
        functioning phone.The messages are still popping out, and the music app
        is still playing songs. The bright colors in order to create a feeling
        of teenage story, and warm memories.

      <p>
        Loosing things truly depresses people, especially loosing thing that
        contains memories and messages. and I can totally understand her. I once
        accidentally deleted a file on my computer which contains my essays and
        pictures in my high school, and I felt sad as if I lost a friend. Her
        discription of her lost phone is clear and is full of visual information
        and details.
