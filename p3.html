      <p>
        This sketch is a moving image of a clock that can interact with the mouse.
        When the mouse appeared on the picture, the background of the sketch will 
        change, as if the clock on the background is moving. The circles moving 
        behind it's body are 'minutes' and 'seconds' while the tiny purple shape 
        appeared between it's eyes is 'hours'. This sketch is done by P5 Javascript.

        Basically this piece is a moving clock, and the figure in the center is the 
        "Time" it self. I created this devil-like figure as the repressentation of 
        time is because time never waits for people, it always consider everyone 
        equally and never agree to give them more times to spend. It's so impartial
        that sometimes it looks a bit scary. the color of green is influenced by a 
        horror story that I read when I was a child: GOOSEBUMPS HORRORLAND THROW 
        BLANKET. The covor of the book is a monster which look like insects and goats.
        It have greenish color and purple linings.
