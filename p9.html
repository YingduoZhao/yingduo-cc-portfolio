        This sketch is a moving image of a wallpainting that can interact with the mouse.
        When the mouse appeared on the picture, the background of the sketch will 
        change, as if the dear in the center is blinking. The circles moving 
        behind it's body are different patterns tooken from the wall paintings from Dunhuang, 
        China. This sketch is done by P5 Javascript.

      <p>
        The above image is the process of my design. This image consists of 3
        parts, refering the flow chart, the first attempt of coding and the second attempt of coding. I found it's very effective to cinside the switch statement function in P5.js as powerpoint slides.

       <p>
        The R key helped people to return back in anytime, the words give them positive feedbacks, 
         the instructions help them to understand what they are doing on each pages and the user agreement circomstances.
      </p>
    
       <p>
          By sepurating the pieces of words in different catalogues and pages, the users can understand what they are doing,
         what are their goals, and what are the risks of using the filter.
       </p>
    
       <p>
          While doing the design, I looked up several examples, and trying to design the filter that makes useragreement meaningful.

        ·I fell much more comfortable with JSP5 now. I guess I improved.

        ·Coding is like teaching the children to learn things. You should never ruch.
