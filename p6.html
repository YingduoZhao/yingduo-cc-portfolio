        Description
      </h1>

      <p>
        This sketch is a design of data analize from my sketch book. I have a habbit
        of doing sketches and draings. Everytime when I got inspirations, or I see 
        some interesting things/experience something interesting, I will write them 
        down/ record them in my sketch book. This sketch book which is been analzed 
        is my 6th sketch book. I started to use it when I started my first day in 
        colledge. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The data analzed in the picture is the compositions inside the sketch book.
        Since I alften carry it around, I pot a lot of wierd things inside my sketch book,
        For examples, drawings, writtings, stickers,napkin papers, candy papers, plants, 
        andflowers. I want to know what are the compositions of them,based on pages, are
        included in my sketh book.
      </p>
      <p>
        I counted the things one by one, and came up with this data as showed on the previous
        picture.

      <p>
        The above image is the process of my design. I counted the different elements 
        that take part in my sketch books(pencle sketches, water colors, special papers, 
        ink pens sketches, writtings...)
      </p>
    
       <p>
        After analyzing the data, I visualized the data by using a histogram.

        ·I realized that there are so many things going on in my sketch book!
          I would love to do more practice on sketching in my sketch book, 
          since I do not want my skills of illustration being forgotten by myself.
        </li>
        <li>
        ·Through data visualization, A lot of detailes were missing in the data. For example, some strange materials,
          different kinds of fabric, and shells, butterfly wings. However, it does
          make me unerstand the general combination of my sketch book.
