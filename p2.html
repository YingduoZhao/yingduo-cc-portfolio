        Description

      <p>
        This sketch is about a polar bear hinding behind a ice cube on the snow.
        While thinking realy hard of what to do with the assignment, my brain came
        up with a recall of a video that I wached recently- a baby polar bear being 
        scared by a baby seal. While noticing giving animals simple-shaped-body and 
        simple-shaped heads makes them cuter, my idea is to draw a cute polar bear.
        My itention is to make the ice cube change it's color randomly, and the 
        polarbear pop it's head up from the cube if the mouse moves inside the ice
        cube. However, I only found out how to make the cube change it's color,
        and didn't find out how to combine the mouse click and the changement
        (and the poping out function).

        For the first assignment, I drew an iphone without using any draft papers,
        and it leads to a mess- I need to adjust the sizes of the shapes appeared 
        on the sketch over and over again, which took a lot of time. For this sketch,
        I made a drawing on line papers before drawing it on JavaScript. It goes like
        this.
