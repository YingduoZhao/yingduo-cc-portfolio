      </h1>

      <p>
        This sketch is a moving image of a wallpainting that can interact with the mouse.
        When the mouse appeared on the picture, the background of the sketch will 
        change, as if the dear in the center is blinking. The circles moving 
        behind it's body are different patterns tooken from the wall paintings from Dunhuang, 
        China. This sketch is done by P5 Javascript.

      <p>
        The above image is the process of my design. This image consists of several
        parts, each part is layered individually, and done by copy& paste and rotation 
        tools in Adobe Illustrator, as you can see in the image. 
      </p>
    
       <p>
        After finishing all the works on illustrator, I uploaded the png files that I
       designed in to P5 Javascript, and employed it into my stetch design.
      </p>
    
       <p>
         The inspiration of my design is the Dunhuang敦煌 Wallpaintings that appeared on the
         celling of the caves and a Bhudism story about a magic deer that can change it's color
         thay was drawn in one of the walls in the caves of Dunhuang. The caves of Dunhhuang were
         located near The Silk Road. During antient times, the commercial activities happened 
         there helped China and countries that close to it got new goods, prospered the Bhuddism 
         arounf the areas, and developed it's unique style of decorative arts around the city.
       </p>
    
       <p>
         The patterns are circulating, representing the river of the slowly moving of history and 
         the lives of the offerers of the cave arets.

          ·Obviously, JavaScript is not good at drawing things.
          So instead of taking endless time drawing thing on it,
          it's more effective to import images into the script, and
          it will not affect anything(except the quality of images,
          I need to figure out how to export high quality pngs from
          Adobe Illustrator.) I love Adobe Creative Clouds. 
        </li>
        ·translating something from my cultural background into digital art does impact 
        some of it's meaning. The most obvious thinng being impact is the image started 
        moving! and it changes color as the mouse change it's location. In the inicial 
        painting, the various concentric circles represent the light shining on the bhuddhas. 
        The antient people drew them overlapping eachother in order to make them vivid. 
        Now, is a more high-technology way, Javascript enabled the picture to make it more 
        interactive, making the scene of the wall painting more vivid, enhansing the "holy"
        of the image. 
        <li>
         ·I believed that the original pattern of the Dunhuang wall paintings were suposed 
          to move, and the reason why it is not moving is because during that time the technology
          cannot allow the image to move. The pattern during the antient times were made for 
          the Buddhas, while this pattern, with collaburation with the javascript, helped the modern 
          people to understand the cculture of buddhism better.
        </li>
          
        <li>
          ·The creation of pattern is really similar to weaving. 
          However, it don't need to be continued again and again by using similar actions.
