      <p>
        This sketch is made of 3 different parts from my group members. During the
        design, everyone were assigned to make a sketch consists of a eadm a body 
        and legs. After making our sketches, the group rearrange everone's sketches
        and change them into new sketches. My finished piece is a rabbit-head-corpse
        with bload flewing out from their body. This sketch is done by P5 Javascript.

        The design is inspired by the movie Pet Sematary filmed based on the novel 
        ‘Pet Sematary' written by Stephen Edwin King. The movie talkes a bout a family
        being influenced by the evil energy from the pet graveyard near their house.

        I received a rabbit head, a human body wearing a T-shirt and a Kaptain Hook's 
        legs from my group mates. They reminded me of the children wearing animal-head-masks walking in 
        the pet graveyard in the movie.

        I tried to make them look creepy by adding blood flows, black-colored-tears and an enlarging 
        red circle that represent bleeding.
