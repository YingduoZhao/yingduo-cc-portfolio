        Description
      </h1>

      <p>
        This sketch is based on my study in the Albert and Vera List Academic Center, also known as the 6E 16th Street building. 
        As a DT student, I spend a lot of my time taking classes and do self studies in the building. I
        nearly went there everyday, and the building itself seemed to become my 'second home'. In the building, 
        I learned a lot of things, such as coding, 3D modeling, and how to build electric hardwares. Hwever, sometimes 
        I feel that this 'second home' blocks myself from seeing the outside world. I love to walk outside, breathing fresh air, and 
        see new people. The building don't have good air circulation system, and it don't have big windows for the light to penetrate through.
        The lights are on during day and night, giving me a feeling that the building itself never changes through time. Looking from the outside,
        the countless windows and the lack of balconies makes this building looks like a cage. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        This camera can be used to taje pictures for the DT studients who study in the Albert and Vera List Academic Center. Since I never went to 
        the building, I cannot tell the influences that the quarantine bring us, but I can be sure that the quarantine makes people feel isolated
        from eachother, and the building helped us to get closeer together again. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The cameras makes us exagreate the things that we like about ourselves, and narrow the things that we don't like about ourselves.
        It can also express a specific type of feeling, or a theme that the users of the filter are interested in.

        After following the tutorials given by Xinxin and Catherin on Youtube, I sucesfully 
         figuredout the way of making pointillist camera filters and making dotted filters. 
         I try to explore my techniques by using colored filters and scanned illustrations to
         create interesting effects.

          路The creation of pattern is really similar to weaving. 
          However, it don't need to be continued again and again by using similar actions.
