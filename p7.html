        Description
      </h1>

      <p>
        Every one of us has a story, a narrative that we either tell to ourselves or others, 
        about who we are. This story can reveal a lot about our interests, values, and history.
      </p>
      <p>
        This design is about my experience of playing in the foreigh sea. When I was a tenager,
        my family always took me to travel to places, especially beaches. We been to tailand, entering
        the woods on an elefhant's head, ordering drinks in the underwayter restaurant, looking at the shadows of fishes fly through 
        the ceiling. We been to Hawaii, picking up coral pieces in the wave of Oahu, throw them high 
        into the air. We counted species of fishes in the beach of the Philippines, soaking ourselves
        in the roof pool of Marina Gold Sands in Singapore. 
      </p>
      <p>
        As the time moves on, I'm 19 now. I will be graduate after 2 and a half years, and startes 
        to exist as a grown up instead of someone's spoiled daughter. My privilege of being a non-responsible
        spoiled princess is vanishing, and I still didn't get prepaired to become an adult yet. I went to the Yangzi 
        river. It was the clsest place to sea in my home town. I saw night herons sitting on the bench, stairing at the
        water for foods to eat. I saw sea gulls floating in the sky. I saw dead fishes floating on the water with their belly
        poniting towards the sky, and the cold and moist wind blowing my hair. Sometimes I wish I could stay in the 
        summer of 2018 forever, standing by the sea, feeling the wave stroking my feed in rhythem like soft winds, stairing at the
        horizon until the sun sets. And when the stars climed up high in the sky, I would pull my chair to the balcony with
        my family, looking at them as if they were fireworks given by the gods in heaven. And the time stopped moving,
        the whole world become scient. All I see and all I can think of, is the movement of the sea and someone surfing in
        the water through the rhythem of the sea. We are all surfers, and that's why I love the sea. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The main character of the game is the surfer appeared on the center of the picture, the little ball. The reason why 
        I use this shape to represent the main character is that I want to create a blurry imag of the past. Normal people
        cannot remenber a scene that they saw a few years ago, and I tried to express the feeling of memories by using abstract
        shapes since it's really difficult for me to remember the actuall look of the surfer. I also put somee previous designs
        of the character in tthe following picture.
      </p>
      <p>
        The scene of the game is the image that I saw at Hawii - under the big blue sky, a surfer is surfing in the sea. They need
        to control their board to avoid themselves from falliing into the water, while the player needs to control the board to
        keep the surfer from falling.

        After analyzing the data, I visualized the data by using a histogram.
